- In the context, that down the line if would be quite interesting to see how your approaches deals with situations where the arm is forced into singularities by the mobile base.
- Outlook for a later chapter: As the performance of your state estimation (EKF on mobile platform) is quite crucial for you overall system performance, you should explicitly validate it through the MoCap.
- Create another chapter for parameter identification on mobile platform.
- At the end of 2.5.3 Model Predictive Control, you are talking about the choice of optimization algo depends on mode complexity etc. Your final decision on which solver you used should be explained as well - potentially based on a performance comparison of different solvers.
